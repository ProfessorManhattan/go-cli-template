## Style Guides

All code projects have their own style. Coding style will vary from coder to coder. Although we do not have a strict style guide for each project, we do require that you be well-versed in what coding style is most acceptable and _best_. To do this, you should read through style guides that are made available by organizations that have put a lot of effort into studying the reason for coding one way or another.

### Recommended Style Guides

Style guides are generally written for a specific language but a great place to start learning about the best coding practices is on [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/). Follow the link and you will see style guides for most popular languages. We also recommend that you look through the following style guides, depending on what language you are coding with:

- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- [PEP 8 Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [Git Style Guide](https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide)

For more informative links, refer to the [GitHub Awesome Guidelines List](https://github.com/Kristories/awesome-guidelines).

### Strict Linting

One way we enforce code style is by including the best standard linters into our projects. We normally keep the settings pretty strict. Although it may seem pointless and annoying at first, these linters will make you a better coder since you will learn to adapt your style to the style of the group of people who spent countless hours creating the linter in the first place.
